# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).- You can edit the [index.js](src/index.js) file to check the result from each of the development steps:

- [Step 1](src/Step1.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Create a component yielding a button.
- [Step 2](src/Step2.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Learn to use **fragments**.
- [Step 3](src/Step3.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Re-introduce components for multiple buttons. 
- [Step 4](src/Step4.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Give each button component a value as a **prop**.
- [Step 5](src/Step5.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Define **event handlers**.
- [Step 6](src/Step6.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Introduce history to the components' value as their **state**.
- [Step 7](src/Step7.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Move state up to parent for syncing.
- [Step 8](src/Step8.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Learn to pass event handlers as **props**.
- [Step 9](src/Step9.js) &nbsp;&nbsp;- Use another state to create player turns.
- [Step 10](src/Step10.js) - Define a function to calculate the winner.
- [Step 11](src/Step11.js) - Create a new parent component to keep the history of all the game.
- [Step 12](src/Step12.js) - Create a list of buttons to **map** each button to a past move.
- [Step 13](src/Step13.js) - Define an event handler for the time-travelling buttons.
- [Step 14](src/Step14.js) - Cleanup unneeded states.

The game examples and code can be found at [Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). There is also an [example on form creation which leverages a utf-8 validator](src/formExample.js) and an [example related to your assignment](src/shipApp.js).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't forget to install the node modules using *package.json*!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
